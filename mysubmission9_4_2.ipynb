After rolling out stores in a few select cities by guessing where the best locations were to open, as part of their store expansion for Paris they've decided to be more informed and selective, and take the time to do some research.\n\nI've been given the exciting task of assisting them to make data-driven decisions on the new locations that are most suitable for their new stores in Paris. This will be a major part of their decision-making process, the other being on the ground qualitative analysis of districts once this data and report are reviewed and studied."

Foursquare data will be very helpful in making data-driven decisions about the best of those areas."

This data strongly suggests that the best places are in fact areas that are near French Restaurants, Caf\u00e9s and Wine Bars. Parisians are very social people that frequent these place often, so opening new stores in these locations is becoming popular.\n\nThe analysis and recommendations for new store locations will focus on general districts with these establishments, not on specific store addresses. Narrowing down the best district options derived from analysis allows for either further research to be conducted, advising agents of the chosen district, or on the ground searching for specific sites by the company's personnel."

The results will be translated to management in a simple form that will convey the data-driven analysis for the best locations to open stores."
